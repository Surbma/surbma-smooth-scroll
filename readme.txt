A very simple and lightweight smooth scroll plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin adds smooth scroll effect to every anchor link on your site. Even in the menu or in any navigation section, if a link is an anchor, the smooth scroll effect will be active on it.

There is no option for this plugin, it just works. :) However if you want to add custom options, you can do that. I don't give any desription to customize, because it needs javascript and WordPress programming knowledge. So if you have the knowledge and experience, you can do it on your own. If you don't have it, than it is not recommended to touch anything, because the plugin is working great with all the default settings.

Surbma - Smooth Scroll plugin is using Ariel Flesler's fantastic jQuery.scrollTo & jQuery.localScroll scripts without any customization and with default settings. The plugin is only integrating the scripts, so you can use it on every WordPress website and the effect will still be active, even if you switch your theme.

You can find and learn more about Ariel Flesler's scroll scripts on their GitHub pages:
